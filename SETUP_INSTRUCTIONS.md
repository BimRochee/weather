# Setup Instructions for Exam Evaluators

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for exam evaluators to run and test the Flutter Weather App on their machines.

## üìã System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- **Flutter SDK**: 3.29.3 or higher
- **Dart SDK**: 3.7.2 or higher
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extensions
- **Android Device** or **Emulator** for testing

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Verify Flutter Installation

```bash
flutter --version
flutter doctor
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Flutter 3.29.3 ‚Ä¢ channel stable
Framework ‚Ä¢ revision ea121f8859
Tools ‚Ä¢ Dart 3.7.2
```

### Step 2: Clone and Navigate to Project

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd weather
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Running "flutter pub get" in weather...
Resolving dependencies...
Got dependencies!
```

### Step 4: Get OpenWeatherMap API Key

1. Visit: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. After login, go to "My API Keys"
4. Copy your API key (it will look like: `abc123def456ghi789`)

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

**Example:**

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=abc123def456ghi789
```

### Step 6: Test Both Data Formats

1. **JSON Format**: The app starts in JSON mode by default
2. **XML Format**: Click the "XML" toggle button in the top-right corner
3. **Verify**: Both formats should display the same weather data

## üì± Testing on Android Device

### Option 1: Physical Device

1. Enable "Developer Options" on your Android device
2. Enable "USB Debugging"
3. Connect device via USB
4. Run: `flutter devices` to verify device detection
5. Run: `flutter run --dart-define=OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY`

### Option 2: Android Emulator

1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to "AVD Manager" (Android Virtual Device Manager)
3. Create and start an emulator
4. Run: `flutter run --dart-define=OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY`

## üèóÔ∏è Building the APK

### Debug APK

```bash
flutter build apk --debug --dart-define=OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### Release APK (Recommended for testing)

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

**APK Location**: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

## üß™ Running Tests

### Unit Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Widget Tests

```bash
flutter test test/widget_test.dart
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Flutter Version Mismatch

```bash
# Update Flutter to latest stable
flutter upgrade
flutter doctor
```

#### 2. Dependencies Issues

```bash
# Clean and reinstall
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

#### 3. API Key Not Working

- Verify API key is correct
- Check if you've exceeded free tier limits
- Ensure proper `--dart-define` syntax

#### 4. Location Permission Issues

- Grant location permissions in device settings
- Ensure GPS is enabled
- Check app permissions in device settings

#### 5. Build Errors

```bash
# Clean build cache
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

## üìä Expected App Behavior

### Initial Launch

1. App requests location permission
2. Shows loading indicator while fetching weather
3. Displays current weather for detected city
4. Shows temperature, condition, and city name

### Format Toggle

1. Click "JSON" button (default)
2. Click "XML" button to switch format
3. Weather data refreshes with new format
4. Same information displayed in different format

### Weather Display

- **City Name**: Large text at top
- **Weather Animation**: Lottie animation based on condition
- **Temperature**: Large number in Celsius
- **Condition**: Weather description below temperature
- **Background**: Dynamic gradient based on weather
